# learning-processing-2020
A repo to store my sketches and projects from the book Learning Processing.
I started learning Processing in April 2020 and finished the Learning Prcessing book in July/August 2020.

## What is Processing?
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.
Processing uses the Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations.
The Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including Arduino, etc.
